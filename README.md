# Thrall-Bot-Cheat-Sheet
This repository is a cheat sheet for the Carl-Bot (renamed Thrall) on the <Get Murked City> discord server.  This does not contain all of the commands available, just the most useful ones.  For a more comprehensive list of commands and functions, you can check out the documentation for Carl-Bot at https://docs.carl.gg/.  You can also access the carl-bot dashboard from the dropdown menu at the main website at https://carl.gg/.

## Introduction

Carl-Bot, also known as **Thrall**, is a discord bot that is employed on our discord server.  There are many different ways that Thrall-bot can be used including auto-moderating the server/channels, giving your user base roles based on emoji specific reactions, and even supplying fun/entertainment based functionality ("~catbomb" command).  However, I will focus on what I think will end up being the most useful (or most used) commands and functions for our use-case.

## Commands

For discord, any bot that is installed will have a set list of commands that can be used.  Thrall-bot commands all start with a prefix.  The Carl-bot default prefix is an exclamation mark (!), but I have configured Thrall-bot to use "**~**" as it's command prefix.  Below I've listed the commands that I find useful or fun.
